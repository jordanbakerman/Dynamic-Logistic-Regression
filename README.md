# Dynamic Logistic Regression

Bayesian Dynamic Logistic Regression and Variable Selection

This Repo provides code files to fit the dynamic logistic regression model (using the FFBS algorithm with unknown variance components) and conduct variable selection (using joint credible regions from the posterior distribution).
